Redirect users to different locations after logging in.

== Description ==

Define a set of redirect rules for specific users, users with specific roles, users with specific capabilities, and a blanket rule for all other users. This is all managed in Settings > Login redirects.

You can use the syntax **[variable]username[/variable]** in your URLs so that the system will build a dynamic URL upon each login, replacing that text with the user's username.

If you're using a plugin such as Gigya that bypasses the regular WordPress redirect process (and only allows one fixed redirect URL), set that plugin to redirect to wp-content/plugins/peters-login-redirect/wplogin_redirect_control.php and set the $rul_use_redirect_controller setting to "true" in the main plugin file.

You can add your own code logic before and between any of the plugin's normal redirect checks if needed. See Other Notes / How to Extend for documentation.

This plugin also includes a function `rul_register` that acts the same as the `wp_register` function you see in templates (typically producing the Register or Site Admin links in the sidebar), except that it will return the custom defined admin address. `rul_register` takes three parameters: the "before" code (by default "&lt;li&gt;"), the "after" code (by default "&lt;/li&gt;"), and whether to echo or return the result (default is `true` and thus echo).

== How to Extend ==

You can write your own code logic before any of this plugin's checks for user-specific, role-specific, and capability-specific redirects, as well as before the fallback redirect URL.

Available filters are:

* rul_before_user
* rul_before_role
* rul_before_capability
* rul_before_fallback

Each takes the same 4 parameters:

* $empty: This is simply set as false in case you don't have any redirect URL to set.
* $redirect_to: Set by WordPress, usually the admin URL.
* $requested_redirect_to: Set by WordPress, usually an override set in a GET parameter.
* $user: A PHP object representing the current user.

Your return value in your own code logic should be the URL to redirect to, or FALSE to continue the plugin's normal checks.

An example of plugin code to redirect to a specific URL for only a specific IP range as the first redirect check:

`function redirectByIP( $empty, $redirect_to, $requested_redirect_to, $user )
{
    $ip_check = '192.168.0';
    if( 0 === strpos( $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $ip_check ) )
    {
        return '/secret_area';
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}

add_filter( 'rul_before_user', 'redirectByIP', 10, 4 );`
